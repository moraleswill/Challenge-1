Module 1 Challenge for UM Coding Boot Camp:

  Using HTML Semantics to clean up the "div soup", grouping selectors with identical styles, and other slight adjustments to refactor and clean up the code.
  
           
           
           Here are the changes I've made to better describe and navigate through it's elements (Detailed comments are inside the HTML/CSS files):
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     

Website Desc. Added to title.

<span class*> in the "Horiseon" header replaced with an id to identify it's unique color.
  
Overused <div*> elements replaced with better descriptive semantic elements (<section*> for main content, <article*> for text within the section, <aside*> for side content).
  
<p*> elements within a <section*> replaced with <article>.
  
<alt*> attributes added to all images.
  
Changed footer class from a <div class*> to an <article id> to identify simply content by itself.
  
Grouped all CSS selectors with identical elements for better organization
